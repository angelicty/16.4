                            I am enjoying the ride and hope that I become a very good programmer. I am a university graduate and in Social science and sociology as my major. I feel like becoming a programmer will be a valuable addition to my skills.
                            I have worked for different organisations and believe in communications. I hope that as a future programmer, I can be use my communication skills to speak to the world. I decided to take coding courses because I thought that having some technical skills is good in life and it will help my career as I am also an inspiring writer.
